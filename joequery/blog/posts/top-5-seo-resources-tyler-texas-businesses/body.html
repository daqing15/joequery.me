SEO is not magic, no matter how much some SEO scammers attempt to convince you otherwise. Search Engine Optimization is simply the implementation of the scientific method in relation to a search engine's algorithm: Hypothesize, experiment, analyze, conclude, and repeat until you find what the search engines like. However, unless you work as a full time SEO, you most likely don't have the time to experiment with on-site modifications and link building methods. In all honesty, one only needs very basic knowledge of search engine optimization techniques to rank above local Tyler competitors. Furthermore, knowing the basics of SEO prevents you from being scammed by shady SEO firms. To arm you with the basics of SEO, we've compiled a list of our 5 favorite SEO resources. 

<h2>1) SEOMoz</h2>
