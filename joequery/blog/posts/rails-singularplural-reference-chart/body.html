{% extends "templates/post.html" %}
{% block post %}

I've begun my descent into pure Rails. The whole naming convention idiom is hard to remember while I'm just learning, so here's a reference chart for myself and for any other Rails noobs. 

<pre class="prettyprint">
# Routes
resources: users

# Controllers
users_controller.rb
class UsersController &lt; ApplicationController
@users = User.all

# Models
user.rb (model)
class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
</pre>
{% endblock post %}
