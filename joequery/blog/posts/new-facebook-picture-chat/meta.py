excerpt="""Two similar but significant changes over the past week highlight the direction in which Facebook is moving when it comes to User Experience (how the user interacts with a web-based environment). 

<h2>Picturfication?</h2>
Facebook rolled out two separate changes to the extremely important chat interface. While some users simply log on Facebook and examine or comment other's profiles, many people's primary use of Facebook is its chat feature. Facebook chat consists of 3 main sections:
<ul>
<li>The sidebar friends list available on your "Home" page</li>
<li>The friends list always available on the bottom right portion of your screen</li>
<li>The chat box itself</li>
</ul>

Facebook has "Picturfied" the sidebar friends list and the chat box. Let's examine the changes in further detail."""
