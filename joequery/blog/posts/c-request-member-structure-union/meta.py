excerpt="""If you're trying to pass a pointer to a structure to a function, you may be getting the compiler error <b>request for member &#8216;SOME_PROPERTY&#8217; in something not a structure or union</b>. If you  <em>swear</em> you're passing in a pointer to the proper structure, and you're <em>certain</em>, there are no typos for the member name you're trying to access, you may just be experiencing a bit of pointer ambiguity."""
