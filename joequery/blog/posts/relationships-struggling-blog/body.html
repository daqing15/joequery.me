Although I'm new to blogging myself, I believe I have found a different perspective that will be changing up how I comment other blogs, and I expect to see great results from it.

If you're like me, you've spent a lot of time making posts and commenting posts, yet you don't have many (if any) subscribers. The problem isn't that you're not posting or commenting enough: You might simply be commenting <strong>the wrong blogs</strong>.

<h2>Find Blogs in a Similar Situation</h2>
I used to try to leave as many comments on the major blogs as possible in order to get more back links. Then I got to thinking:

"There's no way I'm the <em>only</em> struggling blogger doing this."

At that moment I realized the other people who were commenting on those big-shot blog posts could easily be in the same situation I'm in: needing more exposure and needing more back links. So I began to visit the blogs of the people who commented on the same posts, and boy what a treat it was! I have come across some great blogs that deserve more of an audience. These are the types of blogs you should give special attention to if you are struggling with attracting an audience. They are in the same boat as you.

Those of you who are struggling with getting your blog exposed know how exciting it is to finally get a (non spammy) comment or pingback. So excited that you might visit the page of the person who left the comment and take the time reciprocate the favor.

So visit a major blog, find an article with a lot of comments, and check out the links of the people who commented. If they have content relevant to your blog, and you like their articles, leave comments on 2-3 of their posts. This will help establish a mutually beneficial relationship that is more likely to create more back links than just leaving a comment on a top 10 blog.
