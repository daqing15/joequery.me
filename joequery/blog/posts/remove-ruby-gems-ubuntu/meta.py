excerpt="""Recently (as in thirty seconds ago) I needed to remove all ruby gems from my system. After searching the interwebs, I came across an <a href="http://geekystuff.net/2009/01/14/remove-all-ruby-gems/">article</a> explaining how to remove all ruby gems on Fedora core linux.

The snippet adjustment for Ubuntu was easy, just involved remove some quotes and adding sudo. For a detailed explanation on how the command works, check out that article."""
