According to my former Art History professor <a href="http://www.christopher-stewart.com/">Christopher Stewart</a>, there are two reasons why an artist can starve:
<ol>
  <li>His lack of skill</li>
  <li>His integrity</li>
</ol>
The first one makes complete sense. A person who can't draw a straight line shouldn't be paid to be an artist. But why would an artist with skill and integrity starve?"""
