This post serves as an introduction to using Structures in C! This is the first
of many C tutorials I plan on writing.

Reading this Tutorial
---------------------

This tutorial is not meant to be quickly glossed over, unless of course you are
already familiar with the subject matter. Each full program (i.e. any snippets
beginning with `#include`) should be hand-typed, compiled, and ran. I also 
encourage you to try to type the example programs entirely from memory once you
understand them; doing so helps me store new-found knowledge into long-term
memory, and perhaps you'll receive the same benefits!

What is a Structure?
--------------------

As said by Neol Kalicharan in [Data Structures in C][0]:

> "In C, a structure is a collection of one or more variables, possibly of
different types, grouped together under a single name for convenient handling."

Structures are pretty simple to understand just by seeing an example in action.
Compile and run the following:

    #include<stdio.h>

    // Struct declaration
    struct person{
      char *name;
      int age;
      char gender;
    };

    void print_person(struct person);

    int main(){

      // Declaring a variable of type `struct person`
      struct person someguy;
      someguy.name = "Joseph";
      someguy.age = 21;
      someguy.gender = 'M';

      // Print person information
      print_person(someguy);

      return 0;
    }

    // Print a person's information
    void print_person(struct person p){
      printf("Name: %s\n", p.name);
      printf("Age: %d\n", p.age);
      printf("Gender: %c\n", p.gender);
    }

### Explanation

In the Struct declaration section, we define a person type as a structure.
We then define the **fields** of the structure: 

* a pointer to char (to hold a string literal)
* age as an integer 
* gender as a char.

Fields of the structure are accessed via the dot operator.

    #include<stdio.h>

    struct product{
      char *label;
      int value;
    };

    int main(){

      struct product cookie;
      cookie.label = "wonderful cookie";
      cookie.value = 1;

      printf("The %s is $%d\n", cookie.label, cookie.value);

      return 0;
    }

After declaring the person structure, we can now do the same things with 
`struct person` as we would regular data types, such as `int`. 

    // Declaring a variable
    struct person someguy;
    int x;

    // Usage in function parameters
    void print_person(struct person p){
      ... // Do things with p
    }
    void print_number(int num){
      ... // Do things with int
    }

    // Assignment
    struct person someotherguy = someguy;
    int y = x;

    // Operations
    int ageDiff = someotherguy.age - someguy.age;
    int z = x - y;

Tidying up with typedef
-----------------------

If you'd like to eliminate the verbosity of using `struct person` every time 
you're working with a person structure, you can use `typedef`.

typedef works like so:

    typedef datatype newDataTypeName

For example,

    // Using typedef
    #include<stdio.h>

    typedef int WholeNumber;

    int main(){
      WholeNumber x = 10;
      printf("%d is a whole number\n", x);
      return 0;
    }

While this example isn't particularly useful, it lets you understand how 
typedef works. 

Note again that `struct person` behaves like any other data 
type, so the entire structure declaration can be used as the `datatype` 
parameter of typedef. This really cleans up structure usage.

    // Using typedef
    #include<stdio.h>

    typedef struct product{
      char *label;
      int value;
    } product_t;

    int main(){
      product_t cookie; // Was formerly struct product cookie
      cookie.label = "wonderful cookie";
      cookie.value = 1;

      printf("The %s is $%d\n", cookie.label, cookie.value);
      return 0;
    }

Looking again at the usage of typedef (`typedef datatype newDataTypeName`), we
see that `struct product{..}` is the datatype, and `Product` is the 
`newDataTypeName`. We can now use `product_t` in place of `struct product`.
This includes variable assignments, function parameters, everything. (Note
that `product_t` is read "product type", and structures generally follow this
naming convention.)

Applying typedef
----------------

With our newfound knowledge of typedef, lets implement it into our first
program. (This is definitely a code snippet I would attempt to type from 
memory)

    // Using structures in C
    #include<stdio.h>

    // Struct declaration
    typedef struct person{
      char *name;
      int age;
      char gender;
    } person_t;

    void print_person(person_t);

    int main(){

      // Declaring a variable of type `person_t`
      person_t someguy;
      someguy.name = "Joseph";
      someguy.age = 21;
      someguy.gender = 'M';

      // Print person information
      print_person(someguy);

      return 0;
    }

    // Print a person's information
    void print_person(person_t p){
      printf("Name: %s\n", p.name);
      printf("Age: %d\n", p.age);
      printf("Gender: %c\n", p.gender);
    }

Conclusion
----------

Structures are great for representing collections of related attributes, and
they take very little effort to use! We'll cover more involved uses of
structures, such as arrays of structures and pointers to structures, in an
upcoming post.
