excerpt="""As a rails novice, one of the more frustrating things I've encountered with rails is the inability to search for specific method names in its API. This is because a lot of these methods are dynamically generated helpers that you should know by heart once you've mastered the "Rails Way." Unfortunately for me, I'm not at the point of calling myself a Rails guru, so I still need to know what all I have available to me. In my opinion, nothing is more frustrating than not knowing what methods you have at your disposal."""
