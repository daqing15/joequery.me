excerpt="""Regular expressions are a mysterious, extremely useful programming tool. The syntax of Regular Expressions(RegEx) can be extremely daunting for those starting out. Additionally, I've found a lot of RegEx intro guides to be extremely vague, which personally turned me off to learning RegEx for many months. For a while, my "knowledge base" of RegEx consisted of copying and pasting Regular Expression snippets as needed. However, this guide will introduce you to the basics of Regular Expressions in a hopefully extremely accessible manner."""
