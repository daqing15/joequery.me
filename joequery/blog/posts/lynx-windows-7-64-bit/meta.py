excerpt="""If you've tried to install Lynx from the download page while on Windows 7, you might have come across various errors preventing you from installing this great tool. While searching for a solution myself, I came across a <a href="http://www.vordweb.co.uk/standards/download_lynx.htm">Lynx Download Page</a> with instructions that work for Windows 7 64 bit. Just checkout the readme and follow the step by step guide, and you'll be browsing in no time."""
