excerpt="""There exists a notion amongst the SEO community that if you produce great content, the traffic and links will come. You don't have to do anything bit sit in a text editor or illustrative tool and pound out the best content of your life. If it's unique, well written, and useful, you'll get the traffic and links you deserve."""
