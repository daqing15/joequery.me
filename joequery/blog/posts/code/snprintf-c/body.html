[snprintf][0] is essentially a function that redirects the output of printf
to a buffer. This is particularly useful for avoiding repetition of a formatted
string.  You can build a string once and use `printf("%s", mystr)` instead of
`print("%d,%s,%f,%d", x,y,z,a)` every time, which gets cumbersome with actual
variable names.
 
snprintf vs sprintf
-------------------

snprintf is extremely similar to [sprintf][0], which can be found on the same
manpage.  After all, the names of the functions only differ by the character
'n'! This is actually a pretty common convention in C: the function with the 'n'
will require an upper bound or maximum size as an argument. For the most part,
the 'n' version of functions are safer and less susceptible to [buffer
overflows][1]. A significant exception to this rule is [strncpy][2].

Using snprintf
--------------

The function header for snprintf is

    int snprintf(char *str, size_t size, const char *format, ...);

`*str` is the buffer where printf output will be redirected to. `size` is the
maximum number of bytes(characters) that will be written to the buffer,
including the terminating null character that  snprintf **automatically**
places for you. The `format` and the optional `...` arguments are just the
string formats like `"%d", myint` as seen in [printf][3].

### Understanding the effect of size

In the following example, we take a buffer, initialize all its elements, and
run some experiments. We'll alter both the `size` portion of the call to
snprintf as well as the size of the string we're attempting to place into
the buffer.

{{ snippet(p, "snprintf_size.c")|safe}}

The output:

    012345678
    hello th\0
    turtle\078
    2222\05678

Let's say `n` is the index at which snprintf places the null character. `n`
can be formulated as

    n = min(size of format string after substitution, size-1)

(By "after substitution", I mean if we had `"%d",1000`, the format string
after substitution is "1000" and has a size of 4.)

You should take a few minutes to verify this formula for all the examples
above :)

The return value
----------------

Now that we understand how the format string and the `size` argument influence
where snprintf places the null character, we can now discuss the return value
of snprintf and its usefulness.

snprintf returns the size of the format string after substitution.  If the
size of the format string after substitution is greater than or equal to
`size`, that means the string was truncated.  If your buffer size is also
equal to `size` (which it should be when using this function), then this
truncation implies the string was too big to fit in the buffer.

{{ snippet(p, "snprintf_return.c")|safe}}

The output:

    buf: An extrem
    buf: 012345678

The first if statement evaluates to false since the size of the string "hello"
is 6, which is less than the `BUFSIZE` of 10. The second and third statements
evaluate to true since the strings after substitution have a size greater than
or equal to BUFSIZE.

A conservative buffer
---------------------

A good way to demonstrate snprintf is to implement a "conservative buffer".
We will allocate a small amount of memory for a buffer, attempt to place a
string into it, and create a larger buffer if necessary. If the string still
doesn't fit after we create the larger buffer, we'll exit the program.

{{ snippet(p, "snprintf_conservative.c")|safe}}

The output:

    Not enough space. Trying 20 bytes
    There was enough space!
    buf: This is my string!

However, if `bufSize` was initially set to 5, the output would be the
following:

    Not enough space. Trying 10 bytes
    Still not enough space. Aborting
