<u>def</u>: dynamic programming

> A technique for solving problems with overlapping subproblems.

Instead of solving overlapping subproblems again and again, store the results
in a table.

Ex: Fibonacci Sequence
----------------------
{{blogimg(g,post,"img1.jpg")|safe}}

It's easy to see how the Fibonacci sequence spirals out of control in terms of
subproblem overlap. The algorithm ends up recalculating various `F(x)`'s over
and over again, as seen in the `F(5)` example above.

With dynamic programming, instead of recalculating known `F(n)` for `n` we've
already seen, we store `F(n)` in some form of  table and look up the value when
needed.

We can use an array to store the values of `F(n)` as we go. Consequently, the
n-th element of the array is equal to `F(n)`. Instead of substituting backwards
*from* `F(n)` like in most recurrences, we start from `F(0)` and make our way
up to `F(n)`.

You could also avoid the overhead of an array by just keeping track of the last
two numbers in the sequence.

## Computing a binomial coefficient

<u>def</u>: binomial coefficient

> A binomial coefficient C(n,k) is the total number of combinations of k
elements from an n-elemnt set, with 0 &le; k &le; n. This is also known as "n
choose k"
{{blogimg(g,post,"img3.jpg")|safe}}

We can store the values of the recurrence `C(n,k)` in a table like so:
{{blogimg(g,post,"img4.jpg")|safe}}

Note that this forms Pascal's Triangle!

Here's an example where we solve `C(5,2)`
{{blogimg(g,post,"img5.jpg")|safe}}

If we were to look at Pascal's Triangle, the intersection of row `n=5` and
column `k=2` (both 0-indexed) has the value 10. You can look up any of the
other `C(n,k)` values calculated above, and you'll find they are properly
positioned on Pascal's Triangle.

### Algorithm

The algorithm for finding `C(n,k)`

    def binomial(n,k)
        for i=0 to n do
            for j=0 to min(i,k) do
                if j == 0 or j == i
                    C[i,j] = 1
                else
                    C[i,j] = C[i-1, j-1] + C[i-1, j]
        return C[n,k]

### A Python implementation

    def binomial(n,k):
        C = []
        i = 0
        x = 0
        while i <= n:
            j = 0
            C.insert(i, [])
            while j <= min(i,k):
                if j == 0 or j == i:
                    C[i].insert(j, 1)
                else:
                    C[i].insert(j, C[i-1][j-1] + C[i-1][j])
                j += 1
                x += 1
            i += 1
        print("Number of additions: %d" % x)
        return C[n][k]

    print(binomial(5,2)) # 10 

### Analysis

The basic operation is addition, which occurs once each time the inner loop is
executed. The algorithm essentially has two "stages".  In the first stage, we
have `i<k`. This means `min(i,k)==i`, so the inner loop gets executed `i`
times for each iteration of `i` while `i=<k`. Once `i>k`, though,
`min(i,k)==k`, so the inner loop gets executed `k` times for each iteration of
`i` while `i<=n`. Since a single addition occurs for each execution of the
inner loop, we now have all the information we need to come up with a formula
for the number of additions performed by our `binomial(n,k)` algorithm.

Here are a few example tables produced by various calls to `binomial(n,k)`.
Pay close attention to the shape of the tables.
{{blogimg(g,post,"img7.jpg")|safe}}
    
Could you find the pattern of the shapes?
{{blogimg(g,post,"img8.jpg")|safe}}

Each table is split into two shapes: A triangle with height `k+1`, and a
rectangle with height `n-k` and width `k+1`. This is a direct result of the
"stages" of the algorithm described above. Now that we have a higher
understand of how our algorithm builds the table, we can now come up with a
summation for the number of additions executed by `binomial(n,k)`,

Warshall's algorithm: transitive closure
----------------------------------------

<u>def</u>: adjacency matrix

> The adjacency matrix A = {a<sub>ij</sub>} of a directed graph is the boolean
matrix that has 1 in its i-th row and j-th column iff there is a directed
edge from the i-th vertex to the j-th vertex.

<u>def</u>: transitive closure

> The transitive closure of a directed graph with n vertices is an n x n
boolean matrix T = {t<sub>ij</sub>}, where the element in the i-th row and
j-th column is 1 if there exists a nontrivial path from the i-th vertex to the
j-th vertex, and is 0 otherwise.

Example:
{{blogimg(g,post,"img10.jpg")|safe}}

### Generating the transitive closure

We can naively generate the transitive closure of a digraph by doing a
depth-first or breadth-first traversal starting from every vertex. This
introduces a lot of overlap. Warshall's algorithm rectifies this problem by
constructing the transitive closure through a series of `n`x`n`matrices (with
the assumption that the digraph's vertices are numbered from 1 to `n`.)

The series is as follows:

> R<sup>(0)</sup>,...R<sup>(k-1)</sup>,R<sup>(k)</sup>,...R<sup>(n)</sup>

The element r<sub>ij</sub><sup>(k)</sup> is located at the i-th row and j-th
column of the matrix R<sup>(k)</sup>, with `i,j = 1,2,...,n` and
`k=0,1,...,n`. This element is equal to 1 iff there is a nontrivial path from
the i-th vertex to the j-th vertex with each intermediate vertex intermediate
vertex (if any) numbered less than or equal to k. 

Since the vertices are numbered 1 to `n`, elements of R<sup>(0)</sup> equal 1
iff there is a nontrivial path from the i-th vertex to the j-th vertex with no
intermediate vertices. This is the **same thing** as the adjacency matrix.

Elements of R<sup>(1)</sup> equal 1 iff there is a nontrivial path from the
i-th vertex to the j-th vertex, with the vertex `1` allowed as an
intermediate. 

Elements of R<sup>(2)</sup> equal 1 iff there is a nontrivial path from the
i-th vertex to the j-th vertex, with vertices `1` and `2` allowed as
intermediates. 

And so on.

As the `k in R<sup>(k)</sup> increases, we have fewer "restrictions" on what
vertices we can use as intermediates. Thus, we can expect each subsequent
matrix in the series to have more 1's. 

R<sup>(n)</sup> is the transitive closure.

Example:
{{blogimg(g,post,"img11.jpg")|safe}}

Notice how all the elements that are 1's in R<sup>(0)</sup> are 1's in
R<sup>(1)</sup>. Similarly, all the elements that are 1's in R<sup>(1)</sup>
are 1's in R<sup>(2)</sup>.  We can actually compute all elements of each
matrix R<sup>(k)</sup> from its immediate predecessor R<sup>(k-1)</sup>

### Relating the matrices in the series

So how exactly can we relate R<sup>(k)</sup> to R<sup>(k-1)</sup>? Here's how.

Let r<sub>ij</sub><sup>(k)</sup> = 1. By how we've defined `R(k)`, this means
there exists a nontrivial path from the i-th vertex v<sub>i</sub> to the j-th
vertex v<sub>j</sub>, with all intermediate vertices &le; `k`. Let `L` be this
list of intermediate vertices. We can thus describe the path from
v<sub>i</sub> to v<sub>j</sub> as 

**v<sub>i</sub>, L, v<sub>j</sub>**

There are two possible scenarios from this point.

#### First scenario

In the first scenario, the k-th vertex, v<sub>k</sub>, is not in the list of
intermediate vertices `L`. Since all vertices in `L` are less than or equal to
`k` but `k` is not in `L`, all vertices in `L` are less than or equal to
`k-1`. So we have a path **v<sub>i</sub>, L, v<sub>j</sub>** with all vertices
in `L` less than or equal to `k-1`. These conditions are sufficient to
conclude that r<sub>ij</sub><sup>(k-1)</sup> = 1.

#### Second scenario

In the second scenario, the k-th vertex, v<sub>k</sub>, is in the list of
intermediate vertices `L`. We can assume v<sub>k</sub> only occurs once in
`L`. If v<sub>k</sub> does actually appear more than once in `L`, we can
simply reconstruct the list to meet our requirements by eliminating all
vertices between the first and last occurrences of v<sub>k</sub>.
