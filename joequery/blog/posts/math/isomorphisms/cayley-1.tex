Let $G$ be any group. All we know about $\overline{G}$ is that its elements should be permutations. Since we know nothing else about $\overline{G}$, we must use $G$ to construct $\overline{G}$. Elements of $\overline{G}$ should be clearly related to elements of $G$ so that we can easily verify $\phi\colon G \to \overline{G}$ is into when we define $\overline{G}$. So we must create a permutation that somehow uses an arbitrary element of $G$ and, by definition of being a permutation, maps to some element of $G$. One such function is: for any $g$ in $G$, define $T_g(x)=gx$ for all $x$ in $G$. This is essentially multiplication on the left by g. We well take a moment to verify $T_g$ is a permutation on $G$.
