title: Thoughts on proof strategies
description: In your typical undergraduate math textbook, it's fairly
    common to see phrases like "Applying the division algorithm, we see that
    ..." What is almost never explained, though, is why the author felt
    compelled to use the division algorithm in the first place. The tendency
    for textbooks to omit the strategies involved in formulating a proof leads
    to students lacking a sense of direction when tackling proofs on their own.
