More subgroup tests
-------------------

### Two-Step subgroup test

> Let G be a grop and let H be a nonempty subset of G. If ab &isin; H whenever
> a,b &isin; H(H is closed under the operation), and a<sup>-1</sup> &isin; H
> whenever a &isin; H, H is a subgroup of G.

<u><b>Proof:</b></u> Let a,b &isin; H. Since H is non-empty by our hypothesis,
if we can show that ab<sup>-1</sup> &isin; H, then by the one-step subgroup test
H&le;G. Since b &isin; H, b<sup>-1</sup> &isin; H by our hypothesis. Since
a,b<sup>-1</sup> &isin; H , and since H is closed by our hypothesis, we can
conclude ab<sup>-1</sup> is in H.

### Showing a subset is *not* a subgroup

So far, we've gone over two ways to prove if a subset H is a subgroup. But how
can we show that a subset is definitely not a subgroup? Here's a few ways

1. Show e &notin; H
2. Show that there exists an a&isin;H with a<sup>-1</sup>&notin;H.
3. Show that there exists some a,b&isin;H with ab&notin;H.

### Finite Subgroup test

> Let H be a nonempty finite subset of group G. If H is closed under G's
> operation, then H is a subgroup of G.

Examples of Subgroups
---------------------

### Defining &lt;a>

> `<a>` = {a<sup>n</sup> | n&isin;Z} = {a<sup>-1</sup>,a<sup>0</sup>,a<sup>1</sup>,a<sup>2</sup>, ...}.
> a<sup>0</sup> is defined to be the identity.

`<a>` is called the "cyclic subgroup generated by a".

### &lt;a> is a subgroup.

> Let G be a group and let `a` be any element of G. Then `<a>` is a subgroup of G.

Note that xb<sup>-1</sup> was used over the conventional ab<sup>-1</sup> since
we wanted to avoid confusion between the element `a` and the set `<a>`.

#### A note on proof strategy

Similar to the subgroup test proofs in [part 1][1], whenever we perform the
one-step subgroup test and have declared a and b in the subgroup, it's easier to
just start with ab<sup>-1</sup> and verify that it has the properties necessary
to be in the subset. It can be verify difficult to start by taking the values of
a and b and manipulating them to appear in the same form as ab<sup>-1</sup>, so
it's better to start with ab<sup>-1</sup> and simply verify that it has the
needed properties.

### Cyclic groups

In the event that `<a>`=G for some a&isin;G, G is called "cyclic" and a is
called a "generator" of G. Just because `<a>` is infinitely long does not mean
the set produced by it is infinitely long since sets do not have duplicate
elements. 

**Every cyclic group is abelian.** This is because every element in `<a>` is in
the form a<sup>n</sup> for some integer n. So if we were to pick two elements
out of `<a>`, say a<sup>i</sup> and a<sup>j</sup>, performing the group
operation on them yields
a<sup>i</sup>a<sup>j</sup>=a<sup>i+j</sup>=a<sup>j+i</sup>=a<sup>j</sup>a<sup>i</sup>.

### Center of a group

> The center of a group, Z(G), is the set of elements of G that commute with all
> elements of G. Notationally,  
> Z(G)={a&isin;G | ax=xa &forall;x&isin;G}.

### The center is a subgroup

> The center of a group G is a subgroup of G.

### Centralizer of a in G

> Let a be a fixed element of a group G. The centralizer of a in G, C(a), is the
> set of all elements that commute with a. Notationally,  
> C(a) = {g&isin;G | ga=ag}.

### Distinguishing the center and a centralizer

It can be a little difficult to keep the terms "center" and "centralizer"
straight, especially since they sound the same and have similar definitions. Do
your best to remember that the center is associated with an *entire group*,
while the centralizer is associated with a single element in a group.
Additionally, if an element is in C(a) for any a&isin;G, it's guaranteed to be
in Z(G). Think about why :)
