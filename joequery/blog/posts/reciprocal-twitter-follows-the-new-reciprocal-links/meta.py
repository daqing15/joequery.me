excerpt="""I've only been on Twitter for a few weeks, and while I am by no means a <a href="http://socialmediadouchebag.net/">social media guru</a>, I can already tell that a lot of people on Twitter have absolutely no idea what they're doing. Some people feel obligated to Retweet everything they see. Some people feel obligated to follow anyone mentioned in an Retweet. And, as this article will discuss, some people get so excited when someone follows them, they reciprocate the follow - no questions asked. What does this all lead to? Nothing. A whole lot of nothing."""
