No matter what industry you work in, (or even if you're too young to work), task management is a critical component to every day life. Task management not only increases productivity by serving as a reminder of what needs to be done, but task management also serves as a motivational tool for those who are goal-oriented. 

When it comes to task management, I recommended <a href="http://rememberthemilk.com/">Remember The Milk</a>. Remember The Milk(RTM) started off as a simple web application in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20051124024804/http://rememberthemilk.com/">2005</a>. While RTM was a decent utility on its own, an online to-do list didn't appeal to many. What if you were away from your computer? Well, now that the web-based application has <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/services/iphone/">made its way to the iPhone</a>, its appeal and usefulness have increased exponentially.

<h2>Cost</h2>
While the application itself is "free", you must have a Remember The Milk PRO account to use the app. A PRO account costs $25/year, but I guarantee that you will find the service to be worth much more than $25. Those without a PRO membership can try the app for free for 14 days with no credit-card entry. 

<h2>Ease of Use</h2>
The ideal task management app allows for extremely fast task entry and sorting without compromising task detail. Remember The Milk accomplishes this rare feat. 

The application interface allows for four different sorts:
<h3>1) Tasks Due Today</h3>
<img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto;" src="http://assets.vertstudios.com/blog/images/remember-the-milk/remember-the-milk-today.jpg" alt="Remember The Milk" />
The interface displays the task name, the time it's due (if specified), and the associated category.

<h3>2) Tasks Due Tomorrow</h3>
<img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto;" src="http://assets.vertstudios.com/blog/images/remember-the-milk/remember-the-milk-tomorrow.jpg" alt="Remember The Milk" />
In the event you want to look ahead (or the rare event you've finished all your tasks due today), Remember The Milk allows you to conveniently view the tasks scheduled for the next day. 

<h3>3) Tasks Due This Week</h3>
<img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto;" src="http://assets.vertstudios.com/blog/images/remember-the-milk/remember-the-milk-week.jpg" alt="Remember The Milk" />
In case you need to look further ahead in the week to schedule appointments around your to-do list, RTM allows you to do that just as easily. 

<h3>4) Tasks Due by Lists</h3>
<img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto;" src="http://assets.vertstudios.com/blog/images/remember-the-milk/remember-the-milk-lists.jpg" alt="Remember The Milk" />
If you need to isolate tasks by their associated lists, RTM makes the process extremely simple. In case you need to focus on school, chores, or work for the day, you can filter out all other task lists and focus solely on what you need. 

<h3>Creating Tasks</h3>
Task Creation is extremely simple and extremely fast. 

You start by pressing the + button, or for extremely fast entry, the text input on the top of the screen. 
<img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto;" src="http://assets.vertstudios.com/blog/images/remember-the-milk/remember-the-milk-create1.jpg" alt="Remember The Milk" />

The buttons below the text input correlate to different fields, such as date, priority, etc. Simply type your task name and add all the fields you wish.

<h2>More Features</h2>
RTM's app badge by default displays how many tasks remain for the current day. You can change the settings to no badge or the number of incomplete tasks total.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
To those who appreciate the value of great task management, the $25/year fee will be nothing compared to the value Remember The Milk provides. To those who may be skeptical, I invite you to try out the App's 14 day free trial. As always, you're welcome to leave your questions or comments below!
