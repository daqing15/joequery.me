excerpt="""Specifying the problem requirements means you must clearly state the problem. If you can not clearly state the problem, how can you measure whether your project is a solution to that problem? Most web programmers make their projects and then spend time finding out what problems it can solve. That is completely inefficient. It is much better to zero in on the root problem and create a solution. We should strive for purpose driven programming."""
