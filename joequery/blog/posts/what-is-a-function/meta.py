excerpt="""I believe all programmers and computer scientists should take the time to appreciate the foundations of mathematics. If you currently attend a university, I highly encourage you to take a foundations course. Learning math foundations expands your mind, and gives you a greater understanding of the concepts we programmers implement every single day. 

For those of you who do not have the ability or desire to invest in a foundations of mathematics course, but still appreciate the complexities and origins of our field of work, I will very briefly describe what a function really is."""
