excerpt="""In order to inflate their numbers, Yelp does not remove the listings of companies that have been declared out of business. Why display the address, phone number, and reviews of a company that no longer exists? The only possible justification is to inflate the traffic statistics. Deleting a listing at all means a drop in traffic. Now multiply this by every single business that has gone under since Yelp's inception in 2004, and you're looking at a significant amount of traffic decrease. As described before, traffic directly relates to advertising revenue. It's understandable from an economic perspective as to <i>why</i> Yelp keeps these listings active. However, this approach is leading to an extremely negative consequence that Yelp does not seem to care about."""
