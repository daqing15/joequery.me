excerpt="""Welcome to the new Vert Studios website. <a href="http://twitter.com/vertjustin">Justin</a> and I have been working on the redesign since we merged back in July 2010. It's such a great feeling to know the world can finally see the product of your hard work. The project was dynamic, as our vision for Vert Studios changed quite frequently throughout the project. We'd like to share our thought process behind the redesign."""
