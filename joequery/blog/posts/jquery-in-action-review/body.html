My review of jQuery in Action.

<object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/lVv1Qszqbhk&hl=en_US&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/lVv1Qszqbhk&hl=en_US&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object>

Overall I was not very pleased with the book. Very few examples, and the ones provided were mundane and irrelevant to real-world situations. Very sluggish pace and very unsatisfying.

I highly recommend <a href="http://blog.themeforest.net/screencasts/jquery-for-absolute-beginners-video-series/">jQuery for Absolute Beginners</a> as an alternative.
