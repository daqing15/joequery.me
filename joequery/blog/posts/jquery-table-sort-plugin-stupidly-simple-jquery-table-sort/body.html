I needed a simple jQuery plugin to let me sort table columns. Unfortunately, I couldn't find one that captured the simplicity I was looking for. I don't need 1000+ lines of code for a simple table sort!

<h2>The Stupid Table Sort!</h2>
Consequently, I embarked on a journey to create a stupidly simple jQuery table sort plugin. Remaining true to that, I've named the plugin the <a href="http://joequery.github.com/Stupid-Table-Plugin/">Stupid jQuery Table Sort</a>. Flattering name, I know...this is why I'm not a marketer.
