Blog Blueprint
==============

To create a blog post, create a directory with the desired URL within the 
```posts``` directory. Add the name of that directory to the ```rss.txt``` 
file in the posts directory.

* The post itself should be put in a "post.html" file in the directory.
* The description should be placed in a "description.html" file.
